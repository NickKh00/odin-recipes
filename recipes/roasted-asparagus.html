    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div>Fresh asparagus spears are simply seasoned with garlic, topped with shredded Parmesan cheese, and baked until tender and sweet in this easy spring side dish.</div>
    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Oil</strong>: This recipe calls for olive oil cooking spray, but you can easily grease your casserole dish with regular ol' olive oil. </li>
        <li><strong>Asparagus</strong>: Buy plump, firm asparagus stalks with tightly closed tips. The color should be vibrant and unfaded, while the stalks should be roughly the same size for even cooking. </li>
        <li><strong>Parmesan</strong>: Freshly grated Parmesan cheese is best, but pre-shredded will work in a pinch. </li>
        <li><strong>Sea Salt</strong>: Opt for a coarse sea salt for the best results. Kosher salt will work if that's all you have on hand. </li>
        <li><strong>Garlic Powder</strong>: Just a pinch of garlic powder adds bold, herbaceous flavor to this Parmesan-topped roasted asparagus. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). </li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Spray the inside of a 9x13 casserole dish with olive oil cooking spray. Place asparagus in the dish and lightly spray spears with cooking spray. </li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Sprinkle asparagus with Parmesan cheese, sea salt, and garlic powder. </li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong>: Roast in preheated oven until fork easily punctures thickest part of stem, about 12 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
